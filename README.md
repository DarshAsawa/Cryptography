# Cryptography
Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. 

## Cipher
Cipher is an algorithm which is applied to plain text to get ciphertext. It is the unreadable output of an encryption algorithm. The term "cipher" is sometimes used as an alternative term for ciphertext. Ciphertext is not understandable until it has been converted into plain text using a key.

This repository is for learning purpose, sharing implementations for different types of ciphers in Python.
