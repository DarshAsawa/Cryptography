# Substitution Cipher

In substitution cipher, one symbol/character replaces with another. For example, replacing 'A' with 'D'.

## Types: 
 - **Monoalphabetic ciphers** : A character in plaintext is always changed to the same character in the ciphertext regardless of the position.
 - **Polyalphabetic ciphers** : In polyalphabetic substitution, each occurrence of a character may have a different substitute. The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one-to-many. 


## Implementation: 
1. **Additive or Caesar cipher** : Each character is assigned a unique integer value to the selected key value and perform modulo operation (Z26). Each character is assigned a unique integer value to the selected key value and perform modulo operation (Z26). It is also termed as 'Caesar cipher' or 'Shift cipher'.
