# Substitution Cipher

In substitution cipher, one symbol/character replaces with another. For example, replacing 'A' with 'D'.

## Types: 
 - **Monoalphabetic ciphers** : A character in plaintext is always changed to the same character in the ciphertext regardless of the position. It includes additive, multiplicative and affine cipher.
 - **Polyalphabetic ciphers** : In polyalphabetic substitution, each occurrence of a character may have a different substitute. The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one-to-many. It includes autokey, Playfair, Vigenere, Hill cipher.


## Implementation: 
1. **Additive or Caesar cipher** : Each character is assigned a unique integer value to the selected key value and perform modulo operation (Z26). Each character is assigned a unique integer value to the selected key value and perform modulo operation (Z26). It is also termed as 'Caesar cipher' or 'Shift cipher'.

2. **Multiplicative Cipher** : In multiplicative cipher, encryption algorithm specifies multiplication of the plaintext by the key. The key needs to be in Z26*. This set has only 12 members: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25.

3. **Affine Cipher** : Combine additive and multiplicative ciphers. Two keys are used in Affine ciphers. The affine cipher uses a pair of keys in which the first key is from Z26* and the second is from Z26. The size of the key domain is 26 Ã— 12 = 312.

4. **Autokey Cipher** : Autokey Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is closely related to the Vigenere cipher but uses a different method of generating the key. In this cipher, the key is a stream of subkeys which is used to encrypt the corresponding character in the plaintext. It incorporates the message (the plaintext) into the key.

5. **Playfair Cipher** : The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher. The Playfair is significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it.
