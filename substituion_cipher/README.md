# Substitution Cipher

In substitution cipher, one symbol/character replaces with another. For example, replacing 'A' with 'D'.

## Types: 
 - **Monoalphabetic ciphers** : A character in plaintext is always changed to the same character in the ciphertext regardless of the position.
 - **Polyalphabetic ciphers** : In polyalphabetic substitution, each occurrence of a character may have a different substitute. The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one-to-many.
