# Transposition Cipher
Transposition Cipher is a cryptographic algorithm where the order of alphabets in the plaintext is rearranged to form a cipher text. 
In this process, the actual plain text alphabets are not included.

## Implementation:
1. **Columnar Transposition Cipher** : Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.
