# Transposition Cipher
Transposition Cipher is a cryptographic algorithm where the order of alphabets in the plaintext is rearranged to form a cipher text. 
In this process, the actual plain text alphabets are not included.

## Implementation:
1. **Columnar Transposition Cipher** : Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.
2. **Rail Fence Cipher** : Rail fence cipher is deriving its name from the way in which it is encoding. The approach is to rearrange the order of the alphabets to obtain
cipher text. The plaintext is written downwords and diagonally on successive rails of an imaginary fence. After each alphbet has been written, individual rows are combined to obtain the cipher text.
3. **Double Transposition Cipher** : As the name suggests, Double transposition cipher uses two keys to encrypt the text. Columnar tranposition is performed twice using both the keys respectively.
